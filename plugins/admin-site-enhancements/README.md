  * Disable the default **WordPress shortlink &lt;link&gt; tag** in &lt;head&gt;. Ignored by search engines and has minimal practical use case.

  * Disable **jQuery Migrate** script on the frontend, which should no longer be needed if your site uses modern theme and plugins.

### Security

* **Limit Login Attempts**. Prevent brute force attacks by limiting the number of failed login attempts allowed per IP address.
* **Obfuscate Author Slugs**. Obfuscate publicly exposed author page URLs that shows the user slugs / usernames, e.g. _sitename.com/author/username1/_ into _sitename.com/author/a6r5b8ytu9gp34bv/_, and output 404 errors for the original URLs. Also obfuscates in _/wp-json/wp/v2/users/_ REST API endpoint.
* **Email Address Obfuscator**. Obfuscate email address to prevent spam bots from harvesting them, but make it readable like a regular email address for human visitors.
* **Disable XML-RPC**. Protect your site from brute force, DOS and DDOS attacks via XML-RPC. Also disables trackbacks and pingbacks.

### Optimizations

* **Image Upload Control**. Resize newly uploaded, large images to a smaller dimension and delete originally uploaded files. BMPs and non-transparent PNGs will be converted to JPGs and resized.
* **Revisions Control**. Prevent bloating the database by limiting the number of revisions to keep for some or all post types supporting revisions.
* **Heartbeat Control**. Modify the interval of the WordPress heartbeat API or disable it on admin pages, post creation/edit screens and/or the frontend. This will help reduce CPU load on the server.

### Utilities

* **Email Delivery**. Set custom sender name and email. Optionally use external SMTP service to ensure notification and transactional emails from your site are being delivered to inboxes. Send a test email to check if configuration works as intended.
* **Multiple User Roles**. Enable assignment of multiple roles during user account creation and editing. This maybe useful for working with roles not defined in WordPress core, e.g. from e-commerce or LMS plugins.
* **View Admin as Role**. View admin pages and the site (logged-in) as one of the non-administrator user roles.
* **Password Protection**. Password-protect the entire site to hide the content from public view and search engine bots / crawlers. Logged-in administrators can still access the site as usual.
* **Maintenance Mode**. Show a customizable maintenance page on the frontend while performing a brief maintenance to your site. Logged-in administrators can still view the site as usual.
* **Redirect 404 to Homepage**. Perform 301 (permanent) redirect to the homepage for all 404 (not found) pages.
* **Display System Summary**. Show quick summary of the system the site is running on to admins, in the "At a Glance" dashboard widget. This includes the web server software, the PHP version, and the database software.
